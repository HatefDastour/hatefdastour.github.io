    "# TensorFlow Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a powerful field of artificial intelligence that uses neural networks to make sense of data and perform tasks like recognizing images, understanding natural language, and generating speech. These neural networks consist of intricate layers of nodes that perform complex calculations on data inputs and outputs. To efficiently handle this data and speed up these calculations, deep learning relies on a special data structure called **tensors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors can be thought of as a more advanced version of the familiar **arrays** we often use in programming and mathematics. Arrays are collections of elements organized in rows and columns, and tensors share a strong connection with them. Let's explore how they are similar {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Array and Tensor Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multidimensional Flexibility:** Arrays, with their ability to have multiple dimensions, lay the foundation for tensors. In arrays, dimensions are like the arrangement of data in a musical score, with rows and columns. Tensors take this idea further, extending dimensions into a multi-axis arrangement that can adapt to any kind of data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing and Access:** Just like you use indices to access elements in arrays, tensors work the same way for retrieving data. Elements inside both arrays and tensors are accessed and manipulated using indices, making data handling consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Aptitude:** Arrays have a well-established reputation for their mathematical capabilities, crucial for performing various operations. Tensors, as their successors, continue this mathematical legacy, serving as the conduits through which deep learning networks perform complex numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Representation:** Similar to how arrays are used to represent data, tensors take center stage in deep learning. They excel at accurately encapsulating data, whether it's images, text, or sound. These versatile data structures channel the essence of information into the neural network's computational fabric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformations and Operations:** Both arrays and tensors are alike in their transformative nature. They gracefully adapt within their dimensions to accommodate a range of mathematical operations, such as addition, multiplication, and transformation. Just as arrays change during calculations, tensors efficiently absorb operations, enhancing the capabilities of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strong Ties to NumPy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "While tensors may seem like a novel concept in the context of deep learning, it's important to recognize their strong connection to arrays, which have long been fundamental in programming and mathematics. Arrays can be seen as simplified versions of tensors, often with fixed dimensions and data types. Tensors, on the other hand, are more flexible and dynamic, allowing for variable dimensions and data types. Tensors also have some additional features and functionalities that make them more suitable for deep learning, such as automatic differentiation, GPU support, and distributed training. However, tensors and arrays are still compatible and interchangeable, thanks to the NumPy library, which provides a common interface for both data structures. NumPy is a popular Python library that offers a variety of tools and functions for working with arrays and tensors. It allows you to easily create, manipulate, and convert arrays and tensors, as well as perform various mathematical and statistical operations on them. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis, and it serves as the backbone of many other libraries and frameworks, including TensorFlow. TensorFlow is a leading deep learning framework that provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for building, training, and deploying neural networks. TensorFlow uses tensors as its main data structure, and it relies on NumPy for creating and converting tensors from and to arrays. This makes it easy to integrate TensorFlow with other libraries and frameworks that use arrays, such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. By using NumPy and TensorFlow together, you can leverage the power and flexibility of tensors, while also benefiting from the simplicity and familiarity of arrays {cite:p}`prakash2021programming`."

    "\n",
    "- They both support various data types, such as int16, float32, bool, etc. In this example, we specify the data type of the tensor as int16 using the dtype argument {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation` {cite:p}`ramsundar2018tensorflow` .\n",
    "- They both have similar methods to create arrays with specific values, such as tf.ones, tf.zeros, np.ones, np.zeros, etc. In this example, we use tf.constant to create a tensor with constant values {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation` {cite:p}`ramsundar2018tensorflow` .\n",
    "- They both have similar attributes to access the shape and size of the arrays, such as tensor.shape, numpy_array.shape, tensor.size, numpy_array.size, etc. In this example, we print the shape of the tensor and the NumPy arrays using the shape attribute {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation` {cite:p}`ramsundar2018tensorflow` .\n",
    "- They both have similar methods to perform mathematical operations on the arrays, such as tf.add, tf.multiply, np.add, np.multiply, etc. In this example, we do not perform any operations, but we could do so if we wanted to {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation` {cite:p}`ramsundar2018tensorflow` .\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they also have some differences, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- TensorFlow tensors are immutable, meaning that they cannot be modified once created. NumPy arrays are mutable, meaning that they can be modified in place. In this example, we cannot change the values of the tensor, but we can change the values of the NumPy arrays {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation` {cite:p}`ramsundar2018tensorflow` .\n",
    "- TensorFlow tensors can be used to build and run computational graphs that can perform automatic differentiation and optimization for machine learning models {cite:p}`géron2022hands` . NumPy arrays do not have this capability, and are mainly used for numerical analysis and data manipulation. In this example, we do not use any computational graphs, but we could do so if we wanted to build a machine learning model using TensorFlow {cite:p}`abadi2016tensorflow`.\n",
    "- TensorFlow tensors can be executed on different devices, such as CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs, to accelerate the computation {cite:p}`abadi2016tensorflow`. NumPy arrays can only be executed on CPUs, and do not support parallelization or distribution. In this example, we do not specify any device, but we could do so if we wanted to use a different device for the tensor computation {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation` {cite:p}`ramsundar2018tensorflow` .\n",

    "* **Rank**: The rank of a tensor is the number of dimensions it has. A scalar (a single number) has rank 0, a vector (a list of numbers) has rank 1, and a matrix (a table of numbers) has rank 2. The rank of a tensor is also the length of its shape vector.\n",
    "* **Axis** or **Dimension**: An axis or a dimension of a tensor is a specific direction or dimension that the tensor has. For example, a matrix has two axes: the first axis (axis 0) is the rows, and the second axis (axis 1) is the columns. We can use the axis index to access or modify a slice of a tensor along that axis.\n",
    "* **Size**: The size of a tensor is the total number of elements it contains. We can calculate the size of a tensor by multiplying the elements of its shape vector. For example, a tensor with shape `[2, 3]` has a size of 6.\n",

Instead of physically reorganizing the data, a new tensor with the desired shape is generated, while still referencing the same data in memory. TensorFlow follows a memory layout known as \"row-major,\" which means that the elements of a row are stored adjacently in memory. Consequently, incrementing the index on the rightmost side corresponds to traversing through memory in contiguous steps, effectively moving to the next element in the same row. This approach optimizes memory access patterns and aligns with the structure commonly used in C-style programming languages {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation`."
