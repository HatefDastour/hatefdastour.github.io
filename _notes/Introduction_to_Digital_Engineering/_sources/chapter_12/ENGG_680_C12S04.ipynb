    "# Introduction to Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are essential components of TensorFlow that represent shared and persistent state that your program can manipulate. This guide covers how to create, modify, and manage `tf.Variable` instances, which are the core objects that store and update variables in TensorFlow {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `tf.Variable` is a wrapper around a tensor that allows changing its value by applying operations. There are specific operations for reading and writing the values of a variable. Many higher-level frameworks like `tf.keras` use `tf.Variable` to store model parameters, which shows how important variables are for various machine learning tasks {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a variable, you need to provide an initial value, which can be a tensor or any object that can be converted to a tensor. The `tf.Variable` you create will have the same data type (`dtype`) and shape as the initial value {cite:p}`TensorFlowDocumentation`."
