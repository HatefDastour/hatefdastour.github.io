It offers a comprehensive exploration into the fuel efficiency of automobiles manufactured during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The dataset encompasses diverse quantitative and categorical attributes that encompass key automotive characteristics such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight. With a goal of predicting fuel efficiencies, the Auto MPG dataset serves as an invaluable resource for developing and assessing predictive models in the field of automotive engineering and data science. Due to its rich and diverse attributes, it remains a popular choice for educational purposes, research, and practical applications in machine learning and data analysis.\n",

The `extract_features` function is set to `onehot_origin` for feature extraction, and the `norm_x` and `norm_y` instances are used for input normalization and output unnormalization, respectively. This export module can then be used to make predictions on new data points without needing to manually perform feature extraction, normalization, and unnormalization steps."

    "Saving models is crucial when working in platforms like Google Colab due to several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Session Lifetime**: Colab sessions have a limited lifetime. Once the session ends, all data, variables, and models are lost. Saving your model allows you to preserve your work across sessions and avoid retraining from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resource Constraints**: Colab provides limited resources, including memory and GPU availability. Training a complex model can take a significant amount of time and resources. Saving the model allows you to resume training without starting over if the session gets disconnected or terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Time**: Training deep learning models can be time-consuming. Saving the model allows you to train it over multiple sessions and continue training where you left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reproducibility**: Saving the model's state ensures reproducibility. If you achieve a good model, you can save it and share it with others, allowing them to replicate your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deployment**: Once your model is trained, you can deploy it in various applications without needing to retrain it each time. Saving the model's architecture and weights allows you to load it on different platforms for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Experimentation**: When experimenting with different model architectures or hyperparameters, saving models at different stages lets you compare their performance and choose the best configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "By saving your model, you can effectively manage your work, continue training, and deploy models for real-world applications, even in an environment like Google Colab with session limitations.\n",
