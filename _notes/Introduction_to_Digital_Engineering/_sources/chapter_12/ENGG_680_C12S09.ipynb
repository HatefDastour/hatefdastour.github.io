    "### Rescaling Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Rescaling Layer\" is a crucial preprocessing step in neural networks, especially when dealing with image-based tasks. Its primary purpose is to rescale input images to specific dimensions, thereby ensuring consistency in pixel values and creating a standardized input format for subsequent layers in the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of image processing, rescaling involves adjusting the pixel values of input images to a predefined range, commonly between 0 and 1. This normalization serves several important functions. Firstly, it helps prevent numerical instabilities that may arise if pixel values span a broad range, which could impact the stability and convergence of the learning process. Secondly, normalization mitigates the impact of varying illumination conditions or color scales in images, promoting a consistent representation across different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example where an image has pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 (common in grayscale images). The Rescaling Layer would transform these values to a standardized range, such as between 0 and 1, by dividing each pixel value by 255. This normalization ensures that the neural network processes images in a consistent manner, regardless of the original intensity scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "By rescaling pixel values to a standardized range, the neural network becomes less sensitive to variations in absolute intensity across different images. Instead, it focuses on learning the relative relationships between pixel values, enabling the network to extract meaningful patterns and features from the images. This is vital for effective learning, as it ensures that the network's parameters are adjusted based on the intrinsic structure of the data rather than variations in intensity.\n",

Another choice is a padding of 'valid', which means that the input is not padded and the output feature map has a smaller spatial resolution than the input.\n",

A common choice is a ReLU activation function, which sets any negative value to zero and preserves any positive value.

    "\n",
    "Dense layers, also known as fully connected layers, form a fundamental component in the architecture of neural networks, particularly in feedforward neural networks. In a dense layer, each neuron is connected to every neuron in the preceding and succeeding layers, creating a dense network of interconnected nodes. These layers play a crucial role in learning complex representations and capturing intricate relationships within the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical operation in a dense layer involves the weighted sum of the input features, followed by the application of an activation function. The weights associated with these connections are learnable parameters, adapted during the training process through optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. This adaptability allows dense layers to learn and extract hierarchical features, enabling the network to understand intricate patterns and make informed predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='Blue'><b>Example:</b></font> Consider a simple example of a dense layer with three input features (neurons) and two output neurons. The weights associated with each connection are represented by the matrix $ W $, and the biases for the two neurons are denoted by the vector $ b $. The output $ O $ is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} O = \\text{Activation}(W \\cdot X + b) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ X $ is the input vector $[x_1, x_2, x_3]$,\n",
    "- $ W $ is the weight matrix\n",
    "  \\begin{equation} W = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  w_{11} & w_{12} \\\\\n",
    "  w_{21} & w_{22} \\\\\n",
    "  w_{31} & w_{32} \\\\\n",
    "  \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation},\n",
    "- $ b $ is the bias vector $[b_1, b_2]$,\n",
    "- The dot product $ \\cdot $ denotes matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function introduces non-linearity to the model, allowing it to learn and represent complex relationships in the data. Some common choices of activation functions are sigmoid, tanh, relu, softmax, etc. The choice of activation function depends on the type and range of output desired, as well as the characteristics of the input data. For example, sigmoid is often used for binary classification, softmax is used for multi-class classification, relu is used for hidden layers, etc. Different activation functions can have different effects on the output of the layer, such as scaling, shifting, clipping, etc.\n",
