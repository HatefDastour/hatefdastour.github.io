    "# Inheritance and Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance and polymorphism are powerful concepts in object-oriented programming that enable code reuse, extensibility, and flexibility. They enhance the structure and functionality of classes by allowing you to create hierarchies of classes and interact with different classes in a unified way. Let's dive into the intricacies of inheritance and polymorphism {cite:p}`lin2022introduction, wilson2022machine`:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept that enables the creation of new classes (subclasses or derived classes) based on existing ones (superclasses or base classes). This process allows the new class to inherit attributes and methods from the existing class, promoting code reuse and efficient development {cite:p}`lin2022introduction, wilson2022machine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Superclass and Subclass Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of inheritance, the existing class is referred to as the superclass or base class. The new class being created is called the subclass or derived class. The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass, and it can also have additional attributes and methods specific to its own purpose. The subclass extends and refines the functionality of the superclass {cite:p}`lin2022introduction, wilson2022machine`.\n",

    "- The `Car` class is defined as a subclass of `Vehicle`. It has its own `__init__` method that takes both `brand` and `model` as parameters. It uses the `super()` function to call the parent class's `__init__` method and initializes the `model` attribute.

    "In the provided example, the `super()` function is used within the `Car` class's `__init__` method to call the constructor of its superclass, which is the `Vehicle` class. The purpose of using `super()` is to ensure that the initialization code from the parent class is executed before adding any additional attributes or behavior specific to the subclass.\n",

    "    \n",

    "In this code, when you create an instance of the `Car` class, the `__init__` method of the `Car` class is executed. Within this method, the `super().__init__(brand)` line is responsible for calling the `__init__` method of the parent class (`Vehicle`). By doing so, it initializes the `brand` attribute inherited from the `Vehicle` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `super()` is particularly useful when working with inheritance, as it ensures that the common attributes and behavior from the parent class are properly initialized before adding any specific attributes or behavior to the subclass. It helps maintain a consistent object initialization process across the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `start_engine` method in the `Car` subclass overrides the `start_engine` method of the parent class `Vehicle`. This is a common feature in object-oriented programming called method overriding. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. When you define a method with the same name in a subclass, it \"overrides\" the method with the same name in the parent class. This means that when you call `start_engine` on an instance of the `Car` class, the overridden method in `Car` will be executed instead of the one in `Vehicle`.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Subclasses and Method Implementation:**\n",
    "   - The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes inherit from the `Shape` class.\n",
    "   - Each subclass (`Circle` and `Rectangle`) defines its own implementation of the `area` method to calculate the area based on their specific attributes (`radius` for `Circle` and `length` and `width` for `Rectangle`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   - In the last part of the code, a list named `shapes` is created, containing instances of both the `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes.\n",
    "   - The `for` loop iterates through each shape in the `shapes` list.\n",
    "   - Regardless of whether the shape is a `Circle` or a `Rectangle`, the loop treats each shape as an instance of the common base class `Shape`.\n",
    "   - The `area` method is called on each shape, and the appropriate implementation from the respective subclass is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**\n",
    "   - The loop prints the calculated area for each shape, even though they have different implementations for the `area` method.\n",
    "   - This demonstrates that different classes (subclasses) can be treated uniformly through a common interface (`Shape`'s `area` method), showcasing polymorphism."
