    "# Magic Methods (Dunder Methods) in Python (Optional Section)\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic methods, formally known as dunder methods (a contraction of \"double underscore\" methods), hold a special place in Python's object-oriented programming paradigm. These methods are characterized by their names being enclosed in double underscores both at the beginning and end of the method name. They play a crucial role in defining how instances of a class behave when subjected to various operations or functions. By leveraging magic methods, you can finely tailor the behavior of built-in functions, operators, and actions for user-defined objects. This customization empowers you to create objects that are not only powerful but also intuitive and user-friendly {cite:p}`sweigart2020beyond`.\n",

    "## Initialization Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` magic method takes center stage when an object is instantiated. It is automatically invoked and serves as the constructor, responsible for initializing the object's attributes and defining its initial state. In contrast, the `__new__` method precedes `__init__` and is responsible for constructing the instance itself."
