    "Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming (OOP) that emphasizes bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. This practice restricts direct external access to the internal components of the class, promoting data integrity and security. Encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers such as private and protected to control the visibility of attributes and methods {cite:p}`lin2022introduction, nayak2022python`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Private Attribute** (`__salary`):\n",
    "   - The class `Employee` has an attribute called `__salary`, which is designated as private by using double underscores (`__`). This means that it's not directly accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Getter Method** (`get_salary()`):\n",
    "   - To access the private `__salary` attribute, the class provides a public method called `get_salary()`. This method allows external code to retrieve the salary value indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Setter Method** (`set_salary(new_salary)`):\n",
    "   - To modify the salary, the class provides a public method called `set_salary(new_salary)`. This method allows external code to change the salary value but enforces a validation check to ensure that the new salary is greater than zero before making the update.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Usage of Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - When an instance of the `Employee` class is created, like in this case with \"Alice\" and an initial salary of 50000, the actual salary value is encapsulated within the object.\n",
    "   - To access or modify this salary, external code must use the provided getter and setter methods (`get_salary()` and `set_salary(new_salary)`). This encapsulation prevents direct access to the `__salary` attribute from outside the class, ensuring data integrity and control over how it can be manipulated."

In simple words, encapsulation in programming means bundling data (attributes or variables) and the methods (functions or procedures) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It's like putting data and the code that works with that data inside a container to keep them together and hide the inner details from the outside world. This helps in organizing code, maintaining data integrity, and controlling access to the data by providing interfaces (methods) for interacting with it.\n",

    "\n",
    "    1. **Single Underscore `_`**: A single underscore prefix (e.g., `_salary`) is used to indicate that an attribute is intended for internal use within the class or module. It's a signal to other developers that this attribute should be treated as non-public but is not enforced by the language itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Abstract Base Class** (`Shape`):\n",
    "   - The `Shape` class is defined as an abstract base class, which means it cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other shapes but doesn't provide a concrete implementation for the `area()` method. Instead, it declares the `area()` method as an abstract method using `pass`. This enforces that any subclass derived from `Shape` must provide its own implementation of the `area()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concrete Derived Classes** (`Circle` and `Rectangle`):\n",
    "   - The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes are derived from the `Shape` class, inheriting its attributes and behaviors (in this case, the `name` attribute and the `area()` method).\n",
    "   - Each derived class (`Circle` and `Rectangle`) provides its own specific implementation of the `area()` method, which calculates the area based on the properties unique to that shape. For instance, the `Circle` class calculates the area based on its radius, while the `Rectangle` class calculates it based on its length and width.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Usage of Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - When instances of `Circle` and `Rectangle` are created, the code doesn't need to know the specific details of how the area is calculated for each shape. It only needs to interact with the abstract concept of a \"shape\" and call the `area()` method. This is an example of abstraction, as it allows you to work with high-level concepts (shapes and their areas) without concerning yourself with the intricate implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "   - Another aspect of abstraction demonstrated here is polymorphism. The code uses polymorphism to call the `area()` method on different objects (`circle` and `rectangle`) without knowing their concrete types. The appropriate `area()` method is dynamically invoked based on the actual object type, which is a powerful feature of abstraction."
