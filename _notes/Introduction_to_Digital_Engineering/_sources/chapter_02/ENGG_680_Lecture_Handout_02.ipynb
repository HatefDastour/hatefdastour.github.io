    "## Why Use Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of dividing a program into functions might not be\n",
    "immediately apparent in its value. However, there are several compelling\n",
    "reasons why using functions is beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Readability and Debugging:** Creating new functions allows you to\n",
    "    group related statements and give them a meaningful name. This makes\n",
    "    your program **easier to read and understand**. Moreover, when\n",
    "    debugging, having well-defined functions makes it simpler to\n",
    "    pinpoint errors and fix them in specific parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Code Reusability:** Functions can significantly reduce code\n",
    "    duplication. By isolating repetitive code within functions, you only\n",
    "    need to write and maintain that code in one place. **Any changes or\n",
    "    updates are then automatically applied across all instances** where\n",
    "    the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Modularity and Testing:** Dividing a long program into smaller\n",
    "    functions enables you to tackle debugging in a modular way. You can\n",
    "    focus on testing and debugging individual functions independently\n",
    "    before assembling them into the complete program. **This\n",
    "    step-by-step approach makes the debugging process more manageable\n",
    "    and efficient.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Repurposing:** Well-designed functions, once created and debugged,\n",
    "    can be employed in multiple programs. Reusing functions streamlines\n",
    "    the development process for future projects, as **you can leverage\n",
    "    reliable and tested code without having to re-implement it**.\n"
