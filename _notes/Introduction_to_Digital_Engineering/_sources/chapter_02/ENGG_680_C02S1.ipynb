    "## Recursion\n",
    "Recursion is a powerful programming concept in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. It is a fundamental technique used in many algorithms and data structures. Recursive functions break down a complex problem into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem, and combine their results to obtain the final solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The `factorial` function takes one argument, `n`, which represents the number for which we want to calculate the factorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inside the function, there's an `if` statement that checks if `n` is equal to 0. This is known as the base case of the recursion. In mathematics, 0 factorial (0!) is defined to be 1. So, if `n` is 0, the function immediately returns 1, and the recursion stops. This is essential because it provides a base condition to end the recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If `n` is not 0, the `else` block is executed. Here's what happens in the `else` block:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. `n * factorial(n - 1)`: This is the recursive case. It calculates `n` times the factorial of `(n - 1)`. This is based on the fact that the factorial of `n` is defined as `n! = n * (n - 1)!`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b. The `factorial(n - 1)` part is a recursive call to the `factorial` function with `n - 1` as its argument. This means that the function will be called again with a smaller value of `n`. This process continues until `n` reaches 0 (the base case), at which point the recursion stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "   c. The intermediate results are accumulated as each recursive call returns. For example, if you call `factorial(4)`, it calculates `4 * factorial(3)`, then `3 * factorial(2)`, then `2 * factorial(1)`, and finally `1 * factorial(0)`. When `factorial(0)` is reached, it returns 1, and the results are propagated back up the recursion stack to calculate the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The function returns the result of the recursive calculation, which is the factorial of the original `n` provided as an argument.\n",

    "             = 4 * (3 * (2 * factorial(1)))\n",
    "             = 4 * (3 * (2 * (1 * factorial(0))))\n",
    "             = 4 * (3 * (2 * (1 * 1)))\n",

    "             = 4 * 6\n",
