    ":class: important\n",
    "In the context of reading and writing JSON files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FileNotFoundError**: This exception occurs when you attempt to open a file that doesn't exist. It's common when trying to read a file that hasn't been created yet or has been moved or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   To handle `FileNotFoundError`, you can use a `try...except` block. Here's how you can modify the code to handle it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import json\n",
    "\n",
    "   file_path = \"data.json\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       with open(file_path, 'r') as json_file:\n",
    "           loaded_data = json.load(json_file)\n",
    "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "       print(f\"The file '{file_path}' does not exist.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   By catching this exception, your program will print an informative message and continue running rather than crashing if the file is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PermissionError**: This exception occurs when you try to open a file for which you don't have the necessary permissions (e.g., trying to write to a read-only file).\n",
    "\n",
    "   To handle `PermissionError`, you can include it in the `try...except` block like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import json\n",
    "\n",
    "   file_path = \"data.json\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       with open(file_path, 'w') as json_file:\n",
    "           json.dump(data, json_file)\n",
    "   except PermissionError:\n",
    "       print(f\"You do not have permission to write to the file '{file_path}'.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Handling this exception allows your program to provide a clear message to the user if they lack the necessary permissions to perform the file operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Other Exceptions**: There may be other exceptions related to file operations, such as `IOError` or `OSError`, which can occur due to various reasons like disk errors, file locks, or invalid file paths. You can handle these exceptions similarly within your code to ensure robustness.\n",
