    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are used to store and manage data. A variable is a symbolic name that references a value, and you can assign various data types (such as numbers, strings, lists, etc.) to variables. Here are the key points about variables in Python {cite:p}`downey2015think,PythonDocumentation`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Naming Rules:**\n",
    "   - Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "   - The subsequent characters can be letters, underscores, or digits (0-9).\n",
    "   - Variable names are case-sensitive (\"myVar\" and \"myvar\" are considered different).\n",
    "   - Avoid using Python keywords (reserved words) as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assignment:**\n",
    "   - Variables are assigned using the `=` operator.\n",
    "   - The value on the right side of the `=` is assigned to the variable on the left side.\n",
    "   - Example: `x = 5` assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Types:**\n",
    "   - Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the data type when declaring a variable. The interpreter determines the type based on the assigned value.\n",
    "   - Common data types include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reassignment:**\n",
    "   - You can reassign a variable to a new value of a different type.\n",
    "   - Example: `x = 'Hello'` reassigns the variable `x` to the string `'Hello'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Variable Usage:**\n",
    "   - You can use variables in expressions, print statements, function calls, and more.\n",
    "   - Variables hold the value you assigned until you reassign them or the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example that demonstrates variable usage:"

It cannot start with a digit or any other character. Using an underscore as the first character is a common convention for denoting \"private\" variables, but it has a special meaning in some contexts. For example:"

    "2. **Subsequent characters:** After the initial character, a variable name can contain letters, underscores, and digits (0-9).

    "### Invalid Variable Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Invalid variable names violate one or more of the rules mentioned above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Starting with a number:** A variable name that starts with a digit is invalid because it doesn't follow the rule of starting with a letter or underscore. For example:\n",

    "   123data = \"Invalid variable name\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   my-var = \"Invalid variable name\"\n",
    "   my.var = \"Invalid variable name\"\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   if = 42  # Invalid use of a Python keyword\n",

    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types are fundamental classifications that describe the nature of values in a programming language. They specify the kind of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on that data. In Python, which is a dynamically-typed language, data types are determined at runtime. Here are some common data types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Numeric Types**:\n",
    "   - **int**: Represents integer values, such as -3, 0, or 42. These are whole numbers without a fractional part.\n",
    "   - **float**: Represents floating-point numbers with a decimal point or in scientific notation, like 3.14 or 2.5e-3 (which means 2.5 * 10^-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **String Type** (str):\n",
    "   - Represents sequences of characters enclosed in single (' ') or double (\" \") quotes.\n",
    "   - Example: `\"Hello, World!\"`. Strings are versatile and support various operations like concatenation, slicing, and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Boolean Type** (bool):\n",
    "   - Represents the values `True` or `False`, which are used in logical expressions and conditions.\n",
    "   - Example: `True` or `False`. Boolean operations include `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **List Type** (list):\n",
    "   - Represents ordered collections of items, which can be of different data types.\n",
    "   - Lists are mutable, allowing you to add, remove, or modify elements.\n",
    "   - Example: `[1, 2, \"apple\", True]`. Access elements by index, e.g., `my_list[0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tuple Type** (tuple):\n",
    "   - Represents ordered collections of items like lists, but tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).\n",
    "   - Tuples are often used when you want to ensure the integrity of the data.\n",
    "   - Example: `(3, 7, \"banana\")`. Access elements by index, similar to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Dictionary Type** (dict):\n",
    "   - Represents key-value pairs, where each value is associated with a unique key.\n",
    "   - Dictionaries are useful for quick data lookups, and the keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples).\n",
    "   - Example: `{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"Wonderland\"}`. Access values using keys, e.g., `my_dict[\"age\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Set Type** (set):\n",
    "   - Represents unordered collections of unique elements, useful for tasks like removing duplicates.\n",
    "   - Sets do not allow duplicate values, and they support set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
    "   - Example: `{1, 2, 3, 3, 4}`. Create a set using curly braces, e.g., `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **None Type** (NoneType):\n",
    "   - Represents the absence of a value or a null value.\n",
    "   - Often used to indicate the absence of a meaningful result or to initialize variables that will be assigned a value later.\n",
    "   - Example: `None`.\n",
