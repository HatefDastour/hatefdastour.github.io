    "### Variables\n",
    "In Python, a variable serves as a symbolic name that points to a memory location where data can be stored. This naming mechanism enables you to store and retrieve values under specific names. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require explicit variable declaration. Instead, you can effortlessly create a variable by assigning a value to it. The syntax for variable assignment is as follows {cite:p}`downey2015think,PythonDocumentation`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "```\n",

    "In this example, we've created two variables: `age` and `name`, and assigned the values `25` and `\"John Doe\"` to them, respectively.\n",
    "In Python, variable names must follow certain rules to be considered valid. Here are the rules for valid Python variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid Variable Names {cite:p}`downey2015think,PythonDocumentation`:\n",
    "1.\tVariable names **must start with a letter** (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (\\_).\n",
    "2.\tAfter the first character, variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (\\_).\n",
    "3.\tVariable names are **case-sensitive**, meaning `myVariable` and `myvariable` are considered different variables.\n",
    "4.\tVariable names **should not be Python keywords**. Keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings in Python (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, etc.).\n",

    "### Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions in Python are powerful combinations of variables, values, and operators that ultimately resolve to a single value. Python supports various types of expressions, including arithmetic, string, logic, and more. For instance, consider the following example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = 2 * (3 + 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the expression 2 * (3 + 5) gets evaluated to 16, and the resulting value is stored in the variable named result. Expressions allow you to perform calculations and manipulate data efficiently in Python, making it a versatile language for various programming tasks {cite:p}`downey2015think,PythonDocumentation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statements:\n",
    "Statements are instructions that perform actions or operations in Python. They can be as simple as a variable assignment or more complex, like control flow statements (if-else, loops, etc.). A statement usually ends with a newline character or a semicolon (`;`), although using semicolons is not commonly done in Python {cite:p}`downey2015think,PythonDocumentation`.\n",
