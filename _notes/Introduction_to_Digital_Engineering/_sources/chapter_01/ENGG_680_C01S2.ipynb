    "In Python, as in most programming languages, certain rules dictate the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. These rules are known as the \"order of operations\" or \"operator precedence.\" Following the correct order of operations is crucial to getting the expected results from your expressions. The order of operations in Python is as follows, from highest to lowest precedence {cite:p}`downey2015think,PythonDocumentation`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parentheses**: Expressions enclosed in parentheses are evaluated foremost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exponentiation (`**`)**: The exponentiation operator is evaluated subsequently.\n",

    "\n",
