    "Python's popular plotting libraries, Matplotlib and Seaborn, offer a wide range of plot types suitable for various data visualization scenarios. Below is a detailed list of common plot types and the scenarios in which they are typically used {cite:p}`Waskom2021, MatplotlibDocumentation}:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Line Plot:** Used to visualize trends and patterns over continuous data points, such as time series data, stock prices, or any data with a continuous x-axis. It helps show the relationship between two variables over time or a continuous sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scatter Plot:** Suitable for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables. Used to identify correlations or clusters in the data. It helps to understand the distribution and dispersion of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bar Plot:** Used to compare categorical data or discrete variables. Suitable for showing the distribution of data across different categories. It allows easy comparison between different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Histogram:** Used to display the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing it into bins and showing the frequency or count in each bin. It helps to understand the underlying distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pie Chart:** Used to represent parts of a whole, where each segment of the pie represents a percentage of the total. Ideal for showing the proportion of different categories in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot):** Used to visualize the distribution of data and identify outliers. Suitable for comparing multiple datasets or groups. It provides a quick summary of the data's central tendency and variability. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Violin Plot:** Similar to the box plot, but it also shows the probability density of the data at different values, making it ideal for comparing distributions. Useful when comparing multiple groups' distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Heatmap:** Used to display the correlation between variables in a matrix format, with colors representing the magnitude of the correlation. Useful for visualizing relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Pair Plot:** Specifically used in Seaborn. Visualizes the pairwise relationship between multiple variables in a dataset, showing scatter plots and histograms. Helps identify correlations between pairs of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Joint Plot:** Also specific to Seaborn. Combines scatter plots and histograms to show the relationship between two variables and their univariate distributions. Useful for understanding the relationship and distribution of two variables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Contour Plot:** Used to visualize 3D data on a 2D plane by showing lines of constant values (contours) for a third variable. Often used in scientific and engineering data to represent three-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **3D Plot:** Used to visualize three-dimensional data, often for showing complex relationships among three variables. Commonly used in scientific visualization and surface plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Area Plot:** Similar to a line plot, but the area between the line and the x-axis is filled. Useful for visualizing cumulative data or stacked trends. Suitable for showing the composition of data over time or different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Barh Plot (Horizontal Bar Plot):** Similar to a bar plot, but with the bars displayed horizontally. Useful when the category names are lengthy or when comparing data across the y-axis. It offers an alternative view for comparing categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Swarm Plot:** Specifically used in Seaborn. Displays individual data points along a categorical axis, helping to visualize the distribution of data. Suitable for small datasets to show individual data points' positions and density.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) Plot:** Used to estimate the probability density function of a continuous variable. Often used in combination with other plots like the histogram or violin plot. Helps understand the data's underlying continuous distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some of the common plot types used in data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. Depending on your data and specific goals, you might choose one or a combination of these plots to effectively convey insights from your data. Always consider the nature of your data and the message you want to communicate when selecting the appropriate plot type."
