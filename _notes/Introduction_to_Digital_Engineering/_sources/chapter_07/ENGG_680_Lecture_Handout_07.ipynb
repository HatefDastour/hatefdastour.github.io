Dictionaries are mutable, which means you can modify their contents after they are created. They are particularly useful when you need to store and retrieve data based on a unique identifier (the key) {cite:p}`downey2015think,PythonDocumentation`.\n",

    "### 4.4. Similarities and Differences Between Dictionaries and Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries and lists are two common data structures in programming, often used to store and manage collections of items. They have distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different purposes. Here are the similarities and differences between dictionaries and lists {cite:p}`downey2015think,PythonDocumentation`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collection of Items:** Both dictionaries and lists are used to store multiple items or elements in a single data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mutable:** Both dictionaries and lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their contents after creation. You can add, update, or remove items from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iteration:** You can iterate over the items in both dictionaries and lists using loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mixed Data Types:** Both data structures can store elements of various data types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, and even other data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access by Key vs. Index:** The primary difference between dictionaries and lists is how you access their elements. In a dictionary, elements are stored as key-value pairs, and you access an element using its associated key. In a list, elements are stored in a linear fashion, and you access an element using its index (position).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ordering:** Dictionaries in Python (prior to Python 3.7) were unordered collections, meaning the order of elements was not guaranteed. However, starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order. Lists, on the other hand, maintain their order by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Duplication:** In a dictionary, keys must be unique, while values can be duplicated. In a list, elements can be duplicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Usage:** Dictionaries are often used when you have a set of unique keys that map to corresponding values, allowing for efficient lookups and retrieval of values based on keys. Lists are used when you need an ordered collection of items, and you primarily access them based on their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Size:** Dictionaries are typically more memory-intensive than lists because they store both keys and values. Lists only store the values themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Complexity:** The time complexity for accessing an element in a dictionary is typically O(1) on average due to the hash-based indexing of keys. In a list, accessing an element by index has a time complexity of O(1), but searching for an element by value takes O(n) time on average, where n is the number of elements.\n",
