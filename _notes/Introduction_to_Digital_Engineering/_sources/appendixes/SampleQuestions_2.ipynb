    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** B) `np.eye()`\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The correct answer is A) np.identity(). This function returns a square array with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. You can specify the size and data type of the output array as parameters. For example, np.identity(3, dtype=int) will create a 3 x 3 identity matrix of integers. You can also use np.matlib.identity() to create a matrix object instead of an array object.\n",

    "    B) np.eye() is similar to np.identity(), but it allows you to create non-square matrices and specify the position of the diagonal. For example, np.eye(2, 3, k=1) will create a 2 x 3 matrix with ones on the first upper diagonal and zeros elsewhere.\n",

    "   **Answer:** B) `Arr[1, 2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The correct answer is B) `Arr[1, 2]`. This is because NumPy uses zero-based indexing, meaning that the first element of an array has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. Therefore, to access the element in the second row and third column of a 2D array, you need to use the indices 1 and 2 respectively. You can also use a comma-separated notation to specify the indices, such as `Arr[1, 2]`, instead of using nested brackets, such as `Arr[1][2]`. The latter is less efficient and may cause confusion.\n",

    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** \n",
    "\t* `numpy.arange`:\n",
    "\t   - The `numpy.arange` function is used to generate an array with evenly spaced values. It creates an array of values that start at a specified value (or 0 if not specified), increment by a specified step size, and stop before reaching another specified value. The syntax is `numpy.arange([start, ]stop, [step, ]dtype=None)`.\n",
    "\t   - For example, if you use `numpy.arange(0, 10, 2)`, it will generate an array with values [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], starting at 0, incrementing by 2, and stopping before 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* `numpy.linspace`:\n",
    "\t   - The `numpy.linspace` function generates an array of evenly spaced values over a specified range. It takes the starting value, ending value, and the number of values you want in the array as arguments. It divides the specified range into equal parts.\n",
    "\t   - For example, `numpy.linspace(0, 1, 5)` generates an array with values [0. 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0], which are evenly spaced between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* `numpy.logspace`:\n",
    "\t   - The `numpy.logspace` function generates an array of evenly spaced values on a logarithmic scale. It takes the start and stop values, as well as the number of values, and returns an array where the values are logarithmically spaced between the specified range.\n",
    "\t   - For example, `numpy.logspace(0, 1, 5)` generates an array with values [1.0, 3.16227766, 10.0, 31.6227766, 100.0], which are logarithmically spaced between 1 and 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* `numpy.geomspace`:\n",
    "\t   - The `numpy.geomspace` function is similar to `numpy.logspace` and generates values on a logarithmic scale. It takes the start, stop, and the number of values, and returns an array with values evenly spaced in a geometric progression.\n",
    "\t   - For example, `numpy.geomspace(1, 32, 5)` generates an array with values [1. 2. 4. 8. 16.], which are spaced geometrically between 1 and 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tIn this context, the correct answer, `numpy.arange`, is used specifically for generating evenly spaced values by defining a start, end, and step size. The other functions, while useful in different scenarios, serve different purposes like logarithmic spacing or geometric progression."

    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The correct answer is A) Using the `reshape` method. This method allows you to change the shape of an array without changing its data. You need to pass the array and the new shape as parameters to the `reshape` method. The new shape should be compatible with the original shape, meaning that the number of elements in both shapes should be equal. You can also use -1 as one of the dimensions to let NumPy infer the value from the length of the array and the remaining dimensions.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   **Answer:** B) `shape`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Explanation:** The correct answer is B) `shape`. This is because the `shape` attribute of a NumPy array returns a tuple that represents the dimensions of the array. For example, if `arr` is a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns, then `arr.shape` will return `(3, 4)`. The length of the tuple is equal to the number of dimensions (or axes) of the array, which can also be obtained by the `ndim` attribute. The `size` attribute returns the total number of elements in the array, which is equal to the product of the dimensions. The `length` attribute does not exist for NumPy arrays.\n",

    "   \n",
    "    **Answer:** D) `arr[4, 4]`\n",
    "   \n",
    "    **Explanation:** The correct answer is D) `arr[4, 4]`. This is because NumPy arrays use zero-based indexing, meaning that the first element has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on. Therefore, to access the last element of a NumPy array with shape (5, 5), you need to use the indices 4 and 4, which correspond to the fifth row and the fifth column respectively. You can also use negative indices to access elements from the end of the array, such as -1 for the last element, -2 for the second last element, and so on. In this case, you can also use `arr[-1, -1]` to access the last element of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A) `arr[:,-1]` is incorrect because it returns an array of all the elements in the last column of the array, not a single element. The colon (:) means that all the elements along that dimension are selected. For example, `arr[:, -1]` will return:\n",

    "    C) `arr[5, 5]` is incorrect because it raises an IndexError exception. This is because the valid range for each index is from 0 to 4 (inclusive), since the array has shape (5, 5). Using an index of 5 will go beyond the bounds of the array.\n",

    "    **Explanation:** The correct answer is A) An error is raised. This is because NumPy arrays can only be added (or any other arithmetic operation) if they have compatible shapes, which means that either they have the same shape, or one of them has a dimension of size 1 that can be broadcast to match the other array. If these conditions are not met, NumPy will raise a ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together exception, indicating that the arrays have incompatible shapes.\n",

This is because NumPy arrays can be added element-wise using the `+` operator, which is equivalent to using the `np.add()` function. The arrays must have the same shape or be broadcastable to a common shape. In this case, both arrays have the same shape of (3,), so they can be added element-wise without any problem.

The other options are incorrect because:\n",
    "    - B) The `filter` method of a DataFrame does not filter the rows based on their values, but rather on their labels. The argument `\"Age\" > 18` is not a valid label, and will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
    "    - C) The `iloc` method of a DataFrame allows us to select rows based on their integer positions, not their values. The argument `students.Age > 18` is not an integer, and will raise an `IndexError`.\n",
    "    - D) This is the same as option B, and will also raise a `TypeError`.\n",

If there are some rows in either DataFrame that do not have a matching key in the other DataFrame, they will be dropped from the resulting DataFrame. This may result in some missing rows from both DataFrames after the merge. "

    "    The `groupby` method allows us to split a DataFrame into groups based on some criteria and apply a function to each group. The `by` argument specifies the columns or index levels to use as the grouping keys. The `axis` argument defines whether to group by rows (`axis=0`) or columns (`axis=1`). The `as_index` argument determines whether the grouped columns will be the index of the returned object. By default, it is set to `True`, which means the grouped columns will be the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this case, we have `employee_data.groupby(['Department', 'Level'])['Salary'].mean()`, which means we want to group the DataFrame by the columns 'Department' and 'Level', and then calculate the mean of the 'Salary' column for each group. Since we did not specify the `axis` argument, it is assumed to be `0`, which means we are grouping by rows. Since we did not change the `as_index` argument, it is set to `True`, which means the grouped columns will be the index of the returned object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The output will be a Pandas Series with a MultiIndex consisting of the values from the 'Department' and 'Level' columns, and the values from the 'Salary' column as the data. For example, the first group is ('HR', 'Junior'), and the mean salary for this group is 52500.0. Similarly, the second group is ('IT', 'Junior'), and the mean salary for this group is 70000.0. The third group is ('IT', 'Senior'), and the mean salary for this group is 62500.0. Therefore, the result of `employee_data.groupby(['Department', 'Level'])['Salary'].mean()` is a Pandas Series with the following values:\n",

    "   **Explanation:** The primary purpose of a line plot in Matplotlib/Seaborn is B) Show the relationship between two numerical variables. A line plot is a type of graph that displays the continuous relationship between an independent variable (x-axis) and a dependent variable (y-axis) using lines. A line plot can also show the effect of one or more categorical variables on the numerical variables by using different colors, sizes, or styles for the lines. For example, a line plot can show how the temperature changes over time in different seasons, or how the sales of a product vary across different regions. \n",

    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The primary purpose of a box plot in Matplotlib/Seaborn is D) Summarize the distribution and detect outliers in a dataset. A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) shows the distribution of quantitative data in a way that facilitates comparisons between variables or across levels of a categorical variable. The box shows the quartiles of the dataset while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution, except for points that are determined to be “outliers” using a method that is a function of the inter-quartile range. A box plot can help detect outliers in data, as well as determine the symmetry and skewness of the data. A box plot can also show the effect of one or more categorical variables on the numerical variables by using different colors, sizes, or styles for the boxes.\n",

    "   - A) To compare frequencies of different categories.\n",
    "   - B) To visualize the relationship between two numerical variables.\n",
    "   - C) To summarize the distribution of a single numerical variable.\n",
    "   - D) To create a visual summary of a dataset.\n",

    "   **Answer:** C) To summarize the distribution of a single numerical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The most suitable response is C) To summarize the distribution of a single numerical variable. A box plot is a type of plot that displays the five number summary of a dataset, which includes the minimum, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum. A box plot can help visualize the distribution of values in a dataset and see where the five number summary values are located. A box plot can also show the effect of one or more categorical variables on the numerical variable by using different colors, sizes, or styles for the boxes. A box plot can also help detect outliers in data, as well as determine the symmetry and skewness of the data.\n",

    "   - B) Visualize the relationship between two numerical variables.\n",
    "   - C) Display the frequency of data points.\n",

    "   **Answer:** D) Provide a combined view of data distribution and probability density.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The most suitable response is D) Provide a combined view of data distribution and probability density. A violin plot is a type of plot that shows the distribution of quantitative data across several levels of one (or more) categorical variables such that those distributions can be compared. Unlike a box plot, in which all of the plot components correspond to actual data points, the violin plot features a kernel density estimation of the underlying distribution. A violin plot can show the same summary statistics as a box plot, but it also includes additional information about the shape and density of the data. A violin plot can help visualize the variability, skewness, and multimodality of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - A) The data is uniformly distributed.\n",
    "   - B) The data has a narrow range.\n",
    "   - C) The data has many extreme values.\n",

    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** C) The data has many extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The correct answer is C) The data has many extreme values. A box plot shows the distribution of data based on its five-number summary: the minimum, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum. A box plot can also indicate the presence and number of outliers, which are data points that are far away from the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In a box plot, the box is very short, the whiskers are long, and there are multiple outliers. This implies that the data has many extreme values that are not close to the median or the interquartile range. The short box means that the middle 50% of the data is concentrated in a narrow range, while the long whiskers mean that the minimum and maximum values are far away from the box. The outliers are even further away from the whiskers, indicating that they are very different from most of the data.\n",
