# Foundations of Spatial Representation

Map projections and coordinate systems are essential for accurately representing and analyzing spatial data in geographic information science. This chapter examines the challenges of translating the Earth's three-dimensional surface onto a two-dimensional plane, focusing on various map projection methods, each with its own advantages and limitations. 

Understanding coordinate systems is equally important, as they provide the framework for identifying precise locations on Earth. Together, these concepts are fundamental to spatial data analysis, impacting everything from basic mapping to complex geospatial modeling.
