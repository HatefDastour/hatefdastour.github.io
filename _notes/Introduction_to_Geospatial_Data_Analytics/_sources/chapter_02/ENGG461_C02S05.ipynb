    "## Characteristics of Cylindrical Projections\n",
    "\n",
    "Cylindrical projections are a family of map projections that conceptually involve wrapping a cylinder around the Earth and projecting its features onto this surface. When the cylinder is \"unrolled,\" it creates a rectangular map with distinct characteristics {cite}`hinks2016map, snyder_map_1987, robinson1995elements`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Conformal Nature**:\n",
    "   Most cylindrical projections (with notable exceptions like the Mercator) are non-conformal, meaning they do not preserve angles. This results in shape distortion, which becomes more pronounced as you move away from the equator. For instance, landmasses near the poles appear stretched horizontally compared to their actual shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Equal-Area Property**:\n",
    "   Cylindrical projections typically do not preserve area accurately. Regions far from the equator appear disproportionately large compared to their true size. This effect is particularly noticeable in the Mercator projection, where Greenland appears similar in size to Africa, despite being about 14 times smaller in reality {cite}`crew_this_2019`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   {numref}`Comparison_Greenland_Africa_Sizes` compares the sizes of Greenland and Africa using two different map projections:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Mercator Projection** (Left):\n",
    "      - **Distortion**: Greenland appears almost as large as Africa.\n",
    "      - **Usage**: Commonly used for navigation because it preserves angles and directions but distorts size, especially near the poles.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Equal Earth Projection** (Right):\n",
    "      - **Distortion**: Africa is shown significantly larger than Greenland, reflecting their true relative sizes.\n",
    "      - **Usage**: Designed to provide a more accurate representation of area, reducing size distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```{figure} Comparison_Greenland_Africa_Sizes.png\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   align: center\n",
    "   name: Comparison_Greenland_Africa_Sizes\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   Comparison of Greenland and Africa Sizes in Different Projections.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    " \n",
    "3. **Equator Representation**:\n",
    "   The equator is consistently depicted as a straight horizontal line across the map. It is the only parallel of latitude that maintains true scale throughout the projection. This makes cylindrical projections particularly useful for mapping equatorial regions with minimal distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Meridian Representation**:\n",
    "   Meridians (lines of longitude) are represented as equally spaced vertical lines. This creates a grid-like appearance on the map, with all meridians intersecting parallels at right angles. While this makes for a visually organized map, it contributes to the distortion of shapes and areas, especially at high latitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pole Representation**:\n",
    "   A significant limitation of cylindrical projections is their inability to show the poles accurately. As latitude ($\\phi$) approaches ±90°, the mathematical function $\\tan(\\phi)$ approaches infinity. In practice, this means that the poles are either not shown at all or are represented as lines stretching across the entire width of the map, rather than as points.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scale Variation**:\n",
    "   The scale of the map varies depending on the latitude. While the scale along the equator remains constant, it increases dramatically as you move towards the poles. This variation in scale is a primary reason for the area distortion characteristic of cylindrical projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Rhumb Line Representation**:\n",
    "   In some cylindrical projections, like the Mercator, rhumb lines (lines of constant bearing) appear as straight lines. This property made the Mercator projection invaluable for navigation before the advent of GPS technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Symmetry**:\n",
    "   Cylindrical projections typically exhibit symmetry about the equator and the central meridian. This symmetry can be visually appealing and useful for certain applications, but it also means that distortions are mirrored in the northern and southern hemispheres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these characteristics is crucial for cartographers and map users alike. It allows for informed decisions about when to use cylindrical projections and how to interpret the information they present. While cylindrical projections have limitations, particularly in representing polar regions and global scale relationships, they remain valuable for specific applications, especially those focused on equatorial or tropical regions {cite}`robinson1995elements`."

    "## Distortion in Cylindrical Projections\n",
    "\n",
    "Cylindrical projections, particularly the central cylindrical projection, exhibit significant distortion that increases rapidly with distance from the equator. This distortion is primarily due to the mathematical properties of the projection, specifically the behavior of the $\\tan(\\phi)$ function in its formulae {cite}`hinks2016map, wiki_central_2024`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distortion Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minimal Distortion at the Equator**: The equator (0° latitude) serves as the line of tangency between the cylinder and the globe, resulting in minimal distortion along this line {cite}`hinks2016map, wiki_central_2024`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Increasing Distortion with Latitude**: As latitude increases, the distortion becomes more pronounced:\n",
    "   - At approximately 45° latitude, the scale is doubled compared to the equator.\n",
    "   - Beyond 60° latitude, the distortion becomes severe, making these projections impractical for high-latitude regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pole Representation**: In the central cylindrical projection, the poles cannot be represented as they would theoretically be infinitely far from the equator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distortion in cylindrical projections is mathematically described by the secant of the latitude ($\\sec(\\phi)$). For the central cylindrical projection, the north-south stretching is proportional to $\\tan(\\phi)$, which grows even more rapidly than $\\sec(\\phi)$. Due to these distortion characteristics, the central cylindrical projection is seldom used for world maps {cite}`hinks2016map`. "

    "## Lambert Cylindrical Equal-Area Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lambert Cylindrical Equal-Area projection is a cylindrical map projection presented by Swiss mathematician and cartographer Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1772 {cite}`snyder_map_1987, wiki_lambert_2023`. It is one of the most fundamental equal-area projections and serves as the basis for many other cylindrical equal-area projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations for the Lambert Cylindrical Equal-Area projection are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eq_lambert_cylindrical\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "x &= R(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)\n",
    "\\\\ ~\\\\\n",
    "y &= R \\sin\\phi\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $R$ is the radius of the Earth\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is the longitude\n",
    "- $\\lambda_0$ is the central meridian\n",
    "- $\\phi$ is the latitude\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of Lambert Cylindrical Equal-Area:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Equal-Area**: The projection maintains correct area proportions across the entire map, making it useful for comparing the sizes of land masses {cite}`snyder_map_1987`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distortion**: While area is preserved, shape distortion increases rapidly away from the equator. Landmasses appear increasingly compressed in the north-south direction as latitude increases {cite}`wiki_lambert_2023`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Equator**: The projection is undistorted along the equator, which serves as its standard parallel {cite}`wiki_lambert_2023`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Poles**: The poles are represented as straight lines equal in length to the equator {cite}`snyder_map_1987`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Graticule**: Meridians are equally spaced vertical lines, while parallels are unequally spaced horizontal lines {cite}`jenny_guide_2017`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Usage**: It's most suitable for mapping regions near the equator or for thematic maps where preserving area relationships is crucial {cite}`snyder_map_1987`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Variations**: The Lambert projection serves as the basis for other cylindrical equal-area projections like the Gall-Peters, Behrmann, and Hobo-Dyer projections, which adjust the standard parallels to reduce distortion in different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lambert Cylindrical Equal-Area projection's ability to maintain correct area relationships makes it valuable for certain cartographic applications, particularly when comparing the sizes of different regions. However, its significant shape distortion, especially at higher latitudes, limits its use for general-purpose world maps {cite}`jenny_guide_2017`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its limitations, the Lambert Cylindrical Equal-Area projection remains an important tool in cartography, especially as a conceptual basis for understanding equal-area projections and as a starting point for developing more specialized cylindrical equal-area projections {cite}`snyder_map_1987, wiki_lambert_2023`."
