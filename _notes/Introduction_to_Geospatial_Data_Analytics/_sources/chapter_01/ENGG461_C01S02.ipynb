    "## Components of Remote Sensing\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing is a fascinating field that involves capturing and analyzing information about objects or areas from a distance, typically using satellites or aircraft. The selected text you've provided outlines the journey of electromagnetic radiation in remote sensing applications, which includes several key components {cite}`canada_remote_2007`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} components_of_remote_sensing.jpg\n",
    "---\n",
    "align: center\n",
    "---\n",
    "The illustration demonstrates the journey of electromagnetic radiation from its source to its ultimate use in remote sensing applications. Image reproduced based on the idea presented in {cite}`canada_remote_2007`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A. Energy Source:** The primary energy source for remote sensing is the sun. Electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun travels through space and reaches the Earth's atmosphere. Some remote sensing systems also use artificial sources of energy, such as lasers in LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems {cite}`canada_remote_2007`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **B. Atmosphere:** As electromagnetic energy travels through the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with atmospheric particles and gases. This interaction can lead to scattering, absorption, and reflection, which may affect the quality and characteristics of the energy reaching the Earth's surface and the sensors. Atmospheric conditions can influence the accuracy and clarity of the remote sensing data {cite}`canada_remote_2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **C. Target Interaction:** The interaction of electromagnetic energy with a target on the Earth's surface depends on the target's material properties, surface roughness, and the wavelength of the energy. Different materials reflect, absorb, and emit electromagnetic energy differently. For instance, healthy vegetation absorbs most visible light but reflects near-infrared light, making it appear green to human eyes and distinct in infrared images {cite}`canada_remote_2007`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **D. Sensors:** Sensors are devices that detect and measure the energy reflected or emitted from the Earth's surface. They can be mounted on various platforms, including satellites, aircraft, drones, and ground-based stations. Sensors vary in their capabilities, such as spectral resolution (the ability to distinguish different wavelengths of energy), spatial resolution (the size of the area on the ground that each pixel represents), and temporal resolution (how often data is collected for the same area) {cite}`canada_remote_2007`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **E. Transmission, Reception, and Processing:** Once the sensors collect data, it is transmitted to ground stations for processing. This transmission can occur via radio waves or other communication methods. The received data undergoes processing, which includes correcting any distortions, calibrating the sensor data, and converting the raw data into interpretable images or numerical values. Advanced algorithms and software tools are used to enhance the data quality and extract relevant information {cite}`canada_remote_2007`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F. Interpretation and Analysis:**\n",
    "Specialists, such as remote sensing analysts, geographers, and environmental scientists, interpret and analyze the processed data to extract meaningful information. This step involves identifying patterns, anomalies, and trends within the data. For example, analysts might assess the health of vegetation, detect changes in land use, or monitor the extent of natural disasters {cite}`canada_remote_2007`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **G. Application:** The information derived from remote sensing is used in various applications, including weather forecasting, urban planning, environmental management, and military surveillance {cite}`canada_remote_2007`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These components work together to provide valuable insights into the Earth's surface and atmosphere, which can be used for a wide range of practical applications."
