    "{numref}`fig_Calgary_Sentinel2_2A` provides a visual comparison of the city of Calgary using satellite imagery from the Harmonized Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Level-2A {cite}`ESA2024_s2_applications`. The left panel shows the city as it appeared in 2019, while the right panel shows the city in 2024. Both images utilize the Red, Blue, and Green spectral bands, which are commonly used to create natural color images that closely resemble what the human eye would see. The red polygon overlay represents the official city boundary of Calgary as of 2024. This boundary helps to contextualize the urban development and expansion over the five-year period. By comparing the two panels, one can observe changes in land use, such as new developments, changes in vegetation cover, and other environmental changes. These changes are crucial for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and resource management."

    "{numref}`spotpoint` illustrates the concept of **temporal resolution** in remote sensing. Temporal resolution refers to how frequently a satellite can revisit and capture data from the same location on Earth's surface. In the image, two satellites are shown orbiting above the Earth, with their paths intersecting over a specific area. This intersection indicates that the satellites are capturing images or data from this point at different times. The ‘X’ pattern formed by their orbits suggests multiple passes over the same region, allowing for the monitoring of changes over time. Higher temporal resolution means more frequent data collection, which is crucial for applications like environmental monitoring, disaster management, and agricultural planning, where observing changes over time is essential.\n",
