    "# Radiometric Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Radiometric resolution** describes a sensor's ability to distinguish fine gradations in energy levels, which are manifested as differences in image brightness. This is comparable to the human eye's capacity to perceive subtle variations in color shades {cite}`sabins2020remote`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radiometric resolution quantifies the detail within each pixel, defined by the number of bits encoding the energy measured. Each bit corresponds to an exponent of 2, meaning that an 8-bit resolution can represent $2^8$ or 256 distinct digital values, ranging from 0 to 255. Therefore, sensors with a higher radiometric resolution have a broader range of values to encode information, allowing for more precise differentiation of even minor energy variations. For instance, in water quality analysis, high radiometric resolution is crucial for identifying slight changes in ocean hues {cite}`earth_science_data_systems_what_2019`.\n",
