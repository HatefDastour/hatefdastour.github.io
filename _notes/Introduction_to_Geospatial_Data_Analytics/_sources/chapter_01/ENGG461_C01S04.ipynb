    "Spatial resolution measures the smallest feature a sensor can detect. The IFOV and the sensor's altitude work together to define the resolution cell, the smallest area on the ground that can be resolved. If a feature is larger than the resolution cell, it can be detected; if it is smaller, it may not be distinguishable unless it has a dominant reflectance that allows for sub-pixel detection. This concept is crucial for understanding the capabilities and limitations of different remote sensing technologies.\n",

    "- **MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)**: Illustrated by blue boxes, [MODIS](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/sensors/modis) boasts a considerably wider imaging swath, enabling it to cover a larger portion of the Earth's surface per pass and provide global coverage every 1-2 days.\n",
    "- **OLI (Operational Land Imager) aboard Landsat 8**: Displayed as boxes with red dots, the OLI has a narrower swath than MODIS, leading to a longer interval, approximately 16 days, to achieve global coverage.\n",

    "Orbital swath of MODIS (blue boxes) versus the orbital swath of the OLI aboard Landsat 8 (boxes with red dots). Due to its much wider imaging swath, MODIS provides global coverage every 1-2 days versus 16 days for the OLI. Red dots indicate the center point of each Landsat tile.

    "{numref}`figure_landsatmodis` effectively demonstrates the impact of swath width on the temporal resolution of satellite imagery. A wider swath, like that of MODIS, enables more frequent revisits to the same location on Earth, which is beneficial for monitoring changes over time. In contrast, the narrower swath of OLI results in less frequent coverage but can provide higher spatial resolution imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, MODIS is ideal for tracking large-scale environmental changes such as deforestation and urban expansion due to its frequent coverage. Meanwhile, OLI is suitable for detailed analysis of smaller areas with high spatial resolution, such as monitoring crop health or urban infrastructure."

    "\n",
    "To calculate Earth coverage, we need to consider the swath width in relation to the Earth's circumference. The number of orbits required for full Earth coverage can be estimated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " N = \\dfrac{2\\pi R_e}{W \\cos(i)} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $N$ is the number of orbits for full coverage.\n",
    "- $R_e$ is the Earth's radius.\n",
    "- $W$ is the swath width.\n",
    "- $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Earth's Curvature**: For more accurate calculations, especially for wider swaths, the Earth's curvature should be taken into account.\n",
    "2. **Orbit Characteristics**: The satellite's orbit (e.g., sun-synchronous, polar) affects coverage patterns.\n",
    "3. **Sensor Type**: Different sensors (e.g., push-broom, whisk-broom) may have varying swath characteristics.\n",
    "4. **Overlap**: Some degree of overlap between adjacent swaths is often desired for complete coverage.\n",
    "5. **Ground Sampling Distance (GSD)**: This is related to the spatial resolution and can affect the effective swath width. -->"
