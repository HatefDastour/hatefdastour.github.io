# GIS Data Models

This chapter explores the foundational concepts of GIS data models, which are essential for understanding how geospatial data is structured and utilized in geographic information systems. We begin by examining the nature of geospatial data itself, followed by an in-depth look at the two primary data models: vector and raster. Each model offers unique ways to represent spatial information, with vector data focusing on precise points, lines, and polygons, and raster data capturing spatial variability through grid-based cells. The chapter also introduces attribute tables, which store additional information linked to spatial features, enriching the analysis process.
