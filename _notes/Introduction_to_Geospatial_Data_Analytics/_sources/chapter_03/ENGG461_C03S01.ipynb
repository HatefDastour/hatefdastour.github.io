    "In the context of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), real-world observations—encompassing any measurable objects or events in two or three dimensions—must be translated into simplified spatial representations. This process involves distilling complex real-world details into fundamental spatial constructs that can be effectively managed and analyzed within a GIS framework. These constructs are modeled in one of two primary ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Data Model**: This approach captures the geometry and location of spatial entities using points, lines, and polygons. It is well-suited for representing discrete features with clear boundaries and precise locations, such as buildings, roads, or administrative borders. An example of the vector data model is provided in {numref}`vector_example`.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Vector data models will be discussed in greater detail in {numref}`_vector_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Raster Data Model**: In this model, spatial entities are depicted as a uniform grid of cells, with each cell containing a value that represents a specific attribute of that area, such as elevation or temperature. This model is ideal for continuous data that lacks distinct boundaries, like rainfall distribution or land surface temperatures. An example of the raster data model is provided in {numref}`raster_example`.\n",
