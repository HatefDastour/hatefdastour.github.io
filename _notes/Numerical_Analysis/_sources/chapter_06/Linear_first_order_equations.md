## Linear first order equations

If a first order differential equation can be represented as

```{math}
:label: eq:2.1.1
y'+p(t)\,y=f(t),
```

it is considered to be linear. A nonlinear first order differential equation is one that cannot be expressed in this manner {cite:ps}`trench2001elementary`. In equation {eq}`eq:2.1.1`, in case $f \equiv0$, is homogeneous; alternatively, it is nonhomogeneous. Because $y \equiv0$ is clearly a solution of the homgeneous equation,

\begin{equation}
y'+p(t)\,y=0.
\end{equation}

This solution is known as the trivial solution, and any other solution is nontrivial {cite:ps}`trench2001elementary`.

We are interested in finding a solution to a differential equation that satisfies one or even more precise constraints. Such problems are known as **initial value problems**.
