Geometric Vectors

For two given points of $A$ and $B$ in $\R^3$. The geometric vector from $A$ to $B$ is shown by $\overrightarrow{AB}$ which can be regarded as a line from $A$ to $B$ with a direction. In this case, Point $A$ is the tail of $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $B$ is the tip of $\overrightarrow{AB}$.

In the parallelogram generated by two vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, the vector $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$ is the diagonal with the same tail as $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$.

We can move vector $\vec{w}$ in a way that its tail coincides with the tip of $\vec{v}$. In this scenario, the sum $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$ can be seen as moving from the tail of $\vec{w}$ to the head of $\vec{v}$, but first through $\vec{w}$ and then $\vec{v}$.

Similarly, we could also start with the tail of $\vec{v}$ and then the tip of $\vec{w}$.

This is known as as the \textbf{tip-to-tail rule} for
\begin{align*}
\vec{v}+\vec{w}=\vec{w}+\vec{v}
\end{align*}

For subtraction, we proceed as follows. First, let $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ have a common tail. Then, $\vec{v} - \vec{w}$ would be the vector from the tip of $\vec{w}$ to the tip of $\vec{v}$.
