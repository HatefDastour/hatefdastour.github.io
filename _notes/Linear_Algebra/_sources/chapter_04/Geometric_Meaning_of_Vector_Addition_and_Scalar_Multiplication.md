# Geometric Meaning of Vector Addition and  Scalar Multiplication

**Geometric Vectors**:
Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are any two points in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The line
segment from $A$ to $B$ is denoted $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and is called
the geometric vector from $A$ to $B$. Point $A$ is called the tail of
$\overrightarrow{AB}$, $B$ is called the tip of $\overrightarrow{AB}$.

<p>In the parallelogram determined by two vectors <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{w}\)</span>, the vector <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}+\vec{w}\)</span> is the diagonal with the same tail as <span class="math inline">\(\vec{v}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec{w}\)</span>.</p>

If $\vec{w}$ is moved so its tail coincides with the tip of $\vec{v}$ then the sum $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$ is seen as first $\vec{v}$ and then $\vec{w}$.

Similarly, moving the tail of $\vec{v}$ to the tip of $\vec{w}$ shows in following figure that $v+w$ is first $\vec{w}$ and then $\vec{v}$.

This is referred to as the \textbf{tip-to-tail rule}, and it gives graphic illustrations why $\vec{v}+\vec{w}=\vec{w}+\vec{v}$.

If $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ have a common tail, then $\vec{v} - \vec{w}$ is the vector from the tip of $\vec{w}$ to the tip of $\vec{v}$.
