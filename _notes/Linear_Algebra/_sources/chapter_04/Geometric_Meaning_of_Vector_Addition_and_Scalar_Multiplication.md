Geometric Vectors

Let $A$ and $B$ be two arbitrary points in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The geometric vector from $A$ to $B$ it the line segment from point $A$ to point $B$ is (denoted $\overrightarrow{AB}$). Point $A$ is called the tail of $\overrightarrow{AB}$, $B$ is called the tip of $\overrightarrow{AB}$.

In the parallelogram determined by two vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, the vector $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$ is the diagonal with the same tail as $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$.

If $\vec{w}$ is moved so its tail coincides with the tip of $\vec{v}$ then the sum $\vec{v}+\vec{w}$ is seen as first $\vec{v}$ and then $\vec{w}$.

Similarly, moving the tail of $\vec{v}$ to the tip of $\vec{w}$ shows in following figure that $v+w$ is first $\vec{w}$ and then $\vec{v}$.

This is referred to as the **tip-to-tail rule**, and it gives graphic illustrations why $\vec{v}+\vec{w}=\vec{w}+\vec{v}$.

If $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ have a common tail, then $\vec{v} - \vec{w}$ is the vector from the tip of $\vec{w}$ to the tip of $\vec{v}$.
