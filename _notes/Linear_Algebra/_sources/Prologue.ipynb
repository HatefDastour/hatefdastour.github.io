    "Throughout Chapter 1 of the textbook, A First Course in Linear Algebra by K. Kuttler, there are a number of notations and terminologies that are introduced from Chapter 2 onwards. Therefore, in this prologue, we set the stage by briefly discussing some points of notation and terminology that will be used throughout this semester."

    "An equation is a mathematical statement that two things are equal. A mathematical equation is an expression containing at least one variable (an unknown value) and an \"equals sign\" ( = ) with a mathematical expression on each side of it.```\n",

    "\n",
    "Plane is a flat surface that is infinitely large and with zero thickness. For two planes in space we can have either **parallel planes** or **intersecting planes**.\n",

    "#### Parallel planes:\n",

    "Parallel planes are the same distance apart everywhere, and so they never touch.\n",

    "#### Intersecting planes:\n",

    "## Hyperplane\n",
    "In geometry, a **hyperplane** is a subspace whose dimension is one less than that of its ambient space. For example, if a space is 3-dimensional, then its hyperplanes are 2-dimensional planes. Moreover, if the space is 2-dimensional, its hyperplanes are the 1-dimensional lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix is a set of numbers laid out in tabular form (in rows and columns). Usually the numbers are real numbers (real number such as $1$, $5$, $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\frac{2}{3}$,...,\\...). In general, matrices can contain complex numbers[^1]. The rows of a matrix are each left-to-right (horizontal) lines, and the columns of a matrix go top-to-bottom (vertical).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a matrix with four rows and three columns:\n",

    "```{admonition} Remarks\n",
    "1.  Each number that makes up a matrix is called an **element** or an\n",
    "    **entry** of the matrix. The elements (entries) in a matrix have\n",
    "    specific locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, the upper left corner of the matrix is the first row\n",
    "    (or simply, **row 1**) and the first column (or simply, **column\n",
    "    1**). The entry at row 1 and column 1 is 1. Similarly, the entry at\n",
    "    row 4 and column 4 is 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  A matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is referred to as an\n",
    "    $m\\times n$ matrix or as having size $m\\times n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example,\n",
    "    $A=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 &9 \\\\ 10 & 11 & 12 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "    is a $4\\times 3$ matrix (it has four rows and three columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  $A$ matrix of size $1\\times n$ is called a **row matrix** (it just\n",
    "    has a row), whereas one of size $m\\times1$ is called a **column\n",
    "    matrix** (it has only a column).\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3\\end{bmatrix}$ is a row\n",
    "    matrix and $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3\\end{bmatrix}$ is a column\n",
    "    matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  $A$ is a **square matrix** if it has the same number of rows and\n",
    "    columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}$ and\n",
    "    $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 &9\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "    are $2\\times 2$ and $3\\times 3$ square matrices, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Scalar multiplication of matrices**: If $A$ is a matrix and $k$ is\n",
    "    a scalar (scalar is just a number, such as $2$, $3$,\n",
    "    $\\frac{5}{2}$,...), then $kA$ is another matrix which consists of\n",
    "    elements of $A$ multiplied by $k$. See the following examples:\n",
