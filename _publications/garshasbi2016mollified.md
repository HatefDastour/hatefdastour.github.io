<b>Abstract:</b>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This study investigates the application of marching scheme and mollification method to solve a one-dimensional inverse ablation-type moving boundary problem. The problem is considered with noisy data. A regularization method based on a marching scheme and discrete mollification approach is developed to solve the proposed problem and the stability and convergence of the numerical solution are proved. Some numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the attractiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach. It is shown that the results are in good agreement with exact solutions.
