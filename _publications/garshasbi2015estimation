<b>Abstract:</b> 
In this article, a one-dimensional inverse heat conduction problem with unknown nonlinear boundary conditions is studied. In many practical heat transfer situations, the heat transfer coefficient depends on the boundary temperature and the dependence has a complicated or unknown structure. For this reason highly nonlinear boundary conditions are imposed involving both the flux and the temperature. A numerical procedure based on the mollification method and the space marching scheme is developed to solve numerically the proposed inverse problem. The stability and convergence of numerical solutions are investigated and the numerical results are presented and discussed for some test problems.
