<b>Abstract:</b> 
In this paper, we are mainly concerned with the numerical solution of a class of non-well posed semi-linear Cauchy problems for the heat equation. The noisy data are given at the boundary. A stable numerical method based on mollification scheme and marching method is developed to solve the proposed problem. The error of this method is analyzed and some numerical examples are investigated.
