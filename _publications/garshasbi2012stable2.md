<b>Abstract:</b> 
In this paper the application of marching scheme and mollification approach to solve a one dimensional inverse moving boundary problem for the heat equation is investigated. The problem is considered with noisy data. A regularization method based on marching scheme and discrete mollification approach is developed to solve the proposed problem and the stability and convergence of numerical solution is proved. To show the ability and efficiency of the proposed method, some numerical experiments are investigated.
