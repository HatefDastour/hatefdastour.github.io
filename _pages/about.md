<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a researcher with expertise in practical applications of machine learning, deep learning, and big data analysis in environmental modeling and remote sensing. My current research mainly focuses on domains such as forest fire, vegetation analysis, hydrology, and water resources management.
<br>
<br>
I have had the opportunity to teach a range of courses on various subjects such as engineering, machine learning, mathematics, statistics, and data science at the University of Calgary, the University of Lethbridge (Calgary Campus), and Mount Royal University.
<br>
<br>
Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a tech enthusiast with a strong drive to stay informed about new advancements in technology. In my leisure time, I enjoy working out, hiking, and spending quality time with my family and friends.

I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees in Applied Mathematics from Iran before joining the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a> in January 2016 to pursue my Ph.D. studies.
<br>
<br>
During my time at the University of Calgary, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics and Statistics in December 2019. Throughout my academic journey, I engaged in several research projects focused on Applied Numerical Analysis and Mathematics. Additionally, I gained teaching experience as a sessional instructor at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a> for two semesters.
<br>
<br>
Following the completion of my Ph.D. program, I joined <a href="https://stellaralgo.com/" target="_blank">StellarAlgo</a> as a Data Science Developer on January 06, 2020. Subsequently, I joined <a href="https://earthspace.ca/" target="_blank">Earth & Space Inc</a>, where I contributed my expertise in Data Science to assist them with various tasks. Furthermore, I am currently involved as a Sessional Lecturer/Tutorial Instructor at <a href="https://www.mtroyal.ca/" target="_blank">Mount Royal University</a> and the <a href="https://www.ulethbridge.ca/calgary/" target="_blank">University of Lethbridge (Calgary Campus)</a>. Additionally, I hold a position as a Research Associate at the Department of Geomatical Engineering in the Schulich School of Engineering at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a>, where I am pursuing a second Ph.D. degree in Geomatics Engineering.
