<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am an Assistant Teaching Professor of Data Science and Analytics at the MU Institute for Data Science and Informatics. My work lies at the intersection of geomatics, remote sensing, geospatial analytics, and big data. I apply computational methods—including machine learning, data fusion, and agent-based modeling—to address challenges related to climate change, environmental sustainability, natural hazards, and water resources.
<br><br>
I hold dual Ph.D. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Geomatics Engineering, with a focus on geospatial analysis and computational modeling for environmental applications. My research has been supported by the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta and has included projects on forest fires, floods, droughts, and climate-induced land-use change.
<br><br>
Before joining MU, I taught at Mount Royal University, the University of Lethbridge, and the University of Calgary. I also worked in industry as a Data Scientist and Research Scientist, where I developed predictive models, designed scalable data pipelines, and applied analytics to real-world problems using Python, SQL, and cloud-based tools.
<br><br>
I am committed to education and mentorship, having taught courses in machine learning systems and digital engineering. I also contribute to the academic community through thesis examination, journal reviewing, conference organization, and academic leadership. I founded the SIAM Chapter at the University of Calgary and have been active in outreach and community-based initiatives.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and value time with family and friends, which I believe strengthens my role as an educator and mentor.
