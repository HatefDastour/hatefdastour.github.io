<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My name is Hatef Dastour, and I am a Data Science enthusiast. Upon completion of my BSc and MSc degrees in Applied Mathematics in Iran, I joined the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/">University of Calgary</a> to pursue my Ph.D. studies in January 2016.
<br>
Before completing my Ph.D. in Mathematics and Statistics at the end of December 2019, I had finished a number of research projects in the fields of Applied Numerical Analysis and Mathematics, and I had worked as a sessional instructor for a few semesters at the University of Calgary. My research interests focus on the applications of the wave equation in industrial problems and topics in data science.
<br>
I finished my Ph.D. program at the end of December 2019, and then I joined StellarAlgo as a Data Scientist developer on January 06, 2020. After that, I joined Earth & Space Inc. to assist them with various Data Science related tasks.
<br>
I am a tech enthusiast driven to learn about the new advancements in technology. I also enjoy working out, hiking, and spending time with family and friends.
