My name is Hatef Dastour and I am a Data Science enthusiast. Upon completion of my BSc and MSc degrees in Applied Mathematics in Iran, I joined the University of Calgary to pursue my Ph.D. studies in January 2016. Before completing my Ph.D. in December 2019, I had worked on a number of research projects in the fields of Applied Numerical Analysis and Mathematics and had worked as a sessional instructor for a few semesters at the University of Calgary.

I am a tech enthusiast driven to learn about the new advancements in technology. I also enjoy working out, hiking, and spending time with family and friends.
