<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am an experienced educator and researcher with a passion for data science, machine learning, and their applications in solving real-world problems. My expertise spans GIS, remote sensing, data fusion, and geospatial analytics, with a focus on integrating advanced computational methods to address critical issues in environmental processes, climate change, water resources, and natural hazard management.
<br><br>
I have had the privilege of teaching a diverse array of courses, including environmental engineering, machine learning, mathematics, statistics, and data science at the University of Calgary, the University of Lethbridge (Calgary Campus), and Mount Royal University.
<br><br>
Outside of my academic pursuits, I am an avid tech enthusiast and enjoy outdoor activities like hiking. I value work-life balance and cherish time spent with family and friends, which I believe contributes to my effectiveness as an educator and mentor.

I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees in Applied Mathematics from Iran before joining the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a> in January 2016 to pursue my Ph.D. studies.
<br>
<br>
During my time at the University of Calgary, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics and Statistics in December 2019. Throughout my academic journey, I engaged in several research projects focused on Applied Numerical Analysis and Mathematics. Additionally, I gained teaching experience as a sessional instructor at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a> for two semesters.
<br>
<br>
Following the completion of my Ph.D. program, I joined <a href="https://stellaralgo.com/" target="_blank">StellarAlgo</a> as a Data Science Developer on January 06, 2020. Subsequently, I joined <a href="https://earthspace.ca/" target="_blank">Earth & Space Inc</a>, where I contributed my expertise in Data Science to assist them with various tasks. Furthermore, I am currently involved as a Sessional Lecturer/Tutorial Instructor at <a href="https://www.mtroyal.ca/" target="_blank">Mount Royal University</a> and the <a href="https://www.ulethbridge.ca/calgary/" target="_blank">University of Lethbridge (Calgary Campus)</a>. Additionally, I hold a position as a Research Associate at the Department of Geomatical Engineering in the Schulich School of Engineering at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a>, where I am pursuing a second Ph.D. degree in Geomatics Engineering.
<br>
<br>
Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a tech enthusiast with a strong drive to stay informed about new advancements in technology. In my leisure time, I enjoy working out, hiking, and spending quality time with my family and friends.
