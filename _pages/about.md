<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am an Assistant Teaching Professor of Data Science and Analytics at the University of Missouri’s Institute for Data Science and Informatics, and an AI Faculty Fellow within the Graduate School. My work integrates geomatics, remote sensing, geospatial analytics, and artificial intelligence to address challenges in environmental transformation, sustainability, and water resource management. I develop computational frameworks that combine machine learning, data fusion, and simulation modeling to analyze environmental systems and support data-driven decision-making.
<br><br>
I hold dual Ph.D. degrees in Applied Mathematics and Geomatics Engineering from the University of Calgary, where my research focused on computational modeling and geospatial analysis for climate and environmental applications. My work has been supported by the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta, and spans topics including forest fire dynamics, drought and flood risk assessment, and land-use change analysis.
<br><br>
Before joining the University of Missouri, I taught at the University of Calgary, the University of Lethbridge, and Mount Royal University, designing and delivering courses in machine learning systems, life cycle assessment, and digital engineering. My industry experience includes roles as a Data Scientist and Research Scientist, where I developed predictive models, designed data pipelines, and implemented large-scale analytics using Python, SQL, and cloud computing platforms.
<br><br>
At the University of Missouri, I teach and develop graduate courses in natural language processing, geospatial AI, cloud computing, and time series analysis. As an AI Faculty Fellow, I contribute to advancing AI pedagogy, policy development, and faculty training. I also lead curriculum reviews, coordinate research seminars, and serve on graduate admissions committees.
<br><br>
I am committed to inclusive education and professional mentorship, actively engaging in thesis supervision, journal reviewing, and academic leadership. I founded the SIAM Chapter at the University of Calgary and continue to promote collaborative, interdisciplinary learning environments. Outside of academia, I enjoy hiking and spending time with family and friends, which continually inform my perspective as an educator and researcher.
