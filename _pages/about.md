I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees in Applied Mathematics from Iran before joining the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a> in January 2016 to pursue my Ph.D. studies.
<br>
<br>
During my time at the University of Calgary, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics and Statistics in December 2019. Throughout my academic journey, I engaged in several research projects focused on Applied Numerical Analysis and Mathematics. Additionally, I gained teaching experience as a sessional instructor at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a> for two semesters.
<br>
<br>
Following the completion of my Ph.D. program, I joined <a href="https://stellaralgo.com/" target="_blank">StellarAlgo</a> as a Data Science Developer on January 06, 2020. Subsequently, I joined <a href="https://earthspace.ca/" target="_blank">Earth & Space Inc</a>, where I contributed my expertise in Data Science to assist them with various tasks. Furthermore, I am currently involved as a Sessional Lecturer/Tutorial Instructor at <a href="https://www.mtroyal.ca/" target="_blank">Mount Royal University</a> and the <a href="https://www.ulethbridge.ca/calgary/" target="_blank">University of Lethbridge (Calgary Campus)</a>. Additionally, I hold a position as a Research Associate at the Department of Geomatical Engineering in the Schulich School of Engineering at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a>, where I am pursuing a second Ph.D. degree in Geomatics Engineering.
