Abstract: This study deals with the numerical solution of a nonlinear inverse degenerate diffusion problem in petroleum reservoirs. A computational procedure based on the discrete mollification method and the space marching scheme is developed to solve the proposed inverse problem. The stability and convergence of the numerical solution are proved. To demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the new method, two numerical examples are solved. Numerical results show that the new method is effective in solving inverse problems when noisy data is used.
