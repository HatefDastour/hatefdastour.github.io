Summary: Advancements in deep learning, transfer learning, and remote sensing have made it more feasible to address the challenges of classifying Land Use and Land Cover (LULC). In this research, we analyzed 10 deep transfer learning models for LULC classification using the EuroSAT dataset and various accuracy and performance metrics.
