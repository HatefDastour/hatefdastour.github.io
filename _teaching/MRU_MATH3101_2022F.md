In this course, the theory and practice of numerical computational procedures o solve practical problems will be studied. Methods for solutions of nonlinear equations, solutions of simultaneous Flinear equations, curve fitting, solution of the eigenvalue problem, interpolation and approximation, numerical differentiation and integration, and solution of ordinary and partial differential equations are included. The laboratory includes the application to elementary problems and the computer solution of comprehensive problems.
