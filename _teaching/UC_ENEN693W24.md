This course delves into the fundamentals of life cycle assessment (LCA), a critical approach for evaluating the environmental and economic repercussions throughout the lifespan of a product—from the initial extraction of raw materials to the final disposal of residuals. Students will engage in a thorough review and assessment of various LCA tools and frameworks, including process-based, input-output, and hybrid models. The curriculum aims to equip learners with the ability to discern the relative strengths of different methodologies for interpreting and quantifying environmental impacts. Additionally, the course provides real-world case studies demonstrating the application of LCA in environmental engineering and the energy sector, highlighting its significance in sustainable development.
