This course offers an in-depth study of single-variable differential and integral calculus, emphasizing its practical uses. The differentiation portion addresses key concepts like the rules of derivatives, the mean value theorem, optimization methods, and curve sketching, along with their applications in real-life scenarios. The integral calculus part introduces the fundamental theorem of calculus, diverse integration strategies, improper integrals, and the computation of areas in plane figures. Additionally, the course investigates infinite series, encompassing power series, Taylor’s theorem, and the Taylor series.
