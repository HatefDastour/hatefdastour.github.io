In this course, students will explore descriptive statistics and receive an introduction to probability theory. The curriculum also covers a comprehensive study of inferential statistics. Key topics include making inferences about the means and proportions of one or two populations, understanding linear regression and correlation, conducting chi-square tests, and performing an analysis of variance. To apply these concepts to real-world data sets, students will utilize statistical computer software during laboratory sessions.
