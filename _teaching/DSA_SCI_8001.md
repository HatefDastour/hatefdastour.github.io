This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in data science, blending foundational theory with hands-on application. You will examine how NLP techniques and LLMs underpin modern solutions—including automated text analysis, sentiment detection, intelligent chatbots, and generative AI systems. Coursework is anchored by real-world coding exercises and projects that guide you through building end-to-end NLP pipelines, harnessing word embeddings, and deploying transformer-based models. By engaging with state-of-the-art tools such as BERT and GPT, you’ll develop the expertise to implement tasks like classification, language generation, and machine translation, preparing you to innovate and solve data-driven challenges in today’s fast-evolving NLP landscape.
