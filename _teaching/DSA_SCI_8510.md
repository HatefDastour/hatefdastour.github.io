This course offers a comprehensive overview of both theoretical and practical challenges in working with geospatial data, focusing on vector and raster data models. Emphasis is placed on integrating geospatial data throughout the data science lifecycle. Key technical concepts such as data access, indexing, and retrieval are explored in depth. Students will examine major data storage paradigms, including enterprise geospatial databases and desktop GIS systems, as well as scalable computational tools designed for handling Geospatial Big Data beyond traditional desktop environments. Core topics include geospatial data storage, management, analysis, and multi-dataset entity resolution and correlation.
