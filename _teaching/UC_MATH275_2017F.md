This course provides a comprehensive exploration of differential and integral calculus in a single variable, with a strong focus on practical applications. The differentiation section covers important topics such as derivative laws, the mean value theorem, optimization techniques, curve sketching, and their real-world applications. In the integral calculus segment, students will learn about the fundamental theorem of calculus, various integration techniques, improper integrals, and calculating areas of planar regions. The course also delves into infinite series, including power series, Taylor's theorem, and the Taylor series.
