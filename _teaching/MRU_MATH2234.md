This course delves into descriptive statistics and provides a primer on probability theory. The program also offers an in-depth examination of inferential statistics. Essential subjects covered include drawing conclusions about the means and proportions of single or dual populations, grasping linear regression and correlation, executing chi-square tests, and carrying out variance analysis. Students will employ statistical software in lab sessions to apply these principles to actual data sets.
